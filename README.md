The website your are navigating right now is a school project that allowed me to display my different projets, my professional background and my web developer skills. This website is entirely coded with the web trio HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Including bilingual and theme toggles, generation of a timeline and creation of a filter project menu in vanilla JS and the integration of Highchart library.
